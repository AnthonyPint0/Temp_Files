### **Scratch code**
Small programs, test modules, or logic experiments.

### **Temporary data files**
JSON, CSV, or other lightweight datasets used for testing.

## Purpose

This repo is intended to:

- Provide a flexible sandbox for experimentation  
- Keep temporary or in-progress materials organized  
- Act as a holding space before code moves into permanent repositories  
- Maintain reference snippets that may be reused later  

---

## Usage

Feel free to:

- Add or remove files as needed  
- Use the repository for rapid prototyping  
- Store experimental branches without affecting production code  
- Keep notes and reference documents for current projects  

No structure is strictly required, but directories can be added for clarity depending on the type of files you store.
